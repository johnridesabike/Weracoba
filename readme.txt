The theme for https://johnridesa.bike/

== Description ==

Weracoba is my custom-built theme based on [Underscores](https://underscores.me). You can see it in action on my website, [johnridesa.bike](https://johnridesa.bike).

A few key ideas guide its design: minimal use of widgets, major use of categories, and a focus on reading content. Since I keep more than just typical "blog" content on my website, this theme helps organize the different categories.

Although I use Weracoba, it's not quite ready for public distribution. It lacks several features like customizer options and other details that a WordPress administrator will probably need. That being said, feel free to use it. Pull requests, issue submissions, and [emails](https://johnridesa.bike/contact/) are always welcome.

= Tips =

To set up a custom front page, you'll have to set a static front page in the WordPress reading settings. Edit the page you chose and select the "Front Page" template. In the customizer, you can open "Weracoba Options" and input the categories to display.

There are three widget areas: A sidebar that appears beside posts, a sidebar that appears beside the blog index and archive, and the footer. Pages don't have a sidebar. 

Weracoba has some special styling for Gutenberg blocks.
